## Chapter 1: Introduction

### Motivation

Movies -a form of entertainment that has been around for centuries. Yet, the distribution and consumer perceptions of movies have shifted since the introduction of streaming services (Hennig-Hurau et al., 2021; Kumar, 2023). In 2010, the international expansion of Netflix across the globe marked a key point in the growth of on-demand content (Oberoj, 2024). The saturation and availability of the entertainment market have resulted in more critical consumers, which seemingly affects how audiences evaluate films (Hadida et al., 2020). Although research has been performed on movie ratings over time (e.g. Moon et al., 2010; Ramos et al., 2015), the effect of streaming remains rather unexplored.

Over the years, black-and-white deaf movies have advanced to colourful and effects-heavy motion pictures due to technological developments. This is especially prominent in animation, where disruptions in Computer Generated Images (CGI) and production techniques have significantly enhanced visual quality and storytelling opportunities (Sun, 2023). Consequently, audience evaluations of animated films could differ from live-action films. Yet, current research has not addressed this focus on animation.All in all, the present study provides academic relevance by investigating the temporal dynamics on the quality perception of movies, while also accounting for the effect of animation. These insights are also socially relevant for filmmakers and distributors to better understand audiences. The focus of the research can be encapsulated with the following research question:

### Research Question

*To what extent does the release year of a movie influence its average IMDb rating, and does this relationship differ between animated and non-animated films?*

\newpage

## Chapter 2: Literature Review

Ever since the introduction of Netflix, more streaming services have entered the market with players such as Disney+, Amazon Prime Video and HBO Max. Competitiveness rose, resulting in a greater variety of TV shows and movies offered (Thompson, 2024). Simultaneously, the more experienced a viewer is in watching movies, the more criticalthey tend to become (Moon et al., 2009). As such, it could be expected that newer movies are rated worse than older movies because the frame of reference has increased. Additionally, with the rise of digital platforms and social media, review-bombinghas become an omnipresent phenomenon upon the release of new films. Moreover, there has been an increasingly vocal group that criticizes the franchise- and sequel-based strategies that movie corporations have adopted. Furthermore, it could be argued that movie consumers often experience nostalgia for films watched in their childhood, resulting in higher ratings for older movies. Authors such as Bollen et al. (2012) refer to this as a form of “positivity effect.” Overall, these findings underscore the expectation that newer films tend to be rated lower than older films, which will be tested with:

***H1:*** *Movies released after 2010 receive lower average ratings than movies released before 2010.*

Animated films are more easily regarded as timeless, whereas the effect of H1 might differ between the two categories. As such, animation remains memorable due to the distinct visual identity that is rooted in a fantasised setting. In addition, live-action characters' visible age or become outdated due to changes in fashion, technology or cultural norms, while animated characters remain fairly consistent over time(Larson, 2025). For example, Woody from Toy Story remains unchanged in sequels decades after his debut in 1995. On another note, animated films are oftentargeted at children and families, which strengthens the sense of nostalgia through intergenerational re-watches (Lizardi, 2020). The present study will test this with:

***H2:*** *The negative effect of release year (before vs since 2010) on ratings is moderated by animation status, such that the decline is less pronounced for animated movies than for non-animated movies.*

\newpage

## Chapter 3: Methodology

### Data

In order to test H1 and H2 and therefore answer the main research question, secondary data is consulted from [IMDb.com](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/). The database holds several datasets, of which two provide relevance in the context of the present study:

> [title.basics.tsv.gz](https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.basics.tsv.gz), which contains information about the title, runtime, genre and release year of motion pictures.

> [title.rating.tsv.gz](https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.ratings.tsv.gz), which provides data on ratings from all titles. These IMDb ratings are derived from IMDb users and can comprise of movie consumers or professionals.

The dataset merged from the secondary data contains the following variables:

| Variable | Type | Definition |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| tconst | character | Unique IMDb identifier for each title |
| primaryTitle | character | The title most commonly used by the general public |
| startYear | integer | Year the title was released |
| runtimeMinutes | integer | Runtime expressed in minutes |
| genres | character | Genres separated by commas |
| averageRating | numeric | Weighted average IMDb user rating (0.0–10.0) |
| numVotes | integer | Number of votes received by the title |
| before_2010_dummy | dummy | Whether a movie is released before or after 2010 |
| animation_dummy | dummy | Whether a movie is animated or not |

### Type of Analyses

In first assessing whether there was a signifciant difference in rating between animation and non-animation movies, an *independent t-test* was performed.

To test the hypothesis, a linear regression was conducted in R Studio. Release year was treated as the independent variable, and average IMDb user rating as the dependent variable.

Whether a movie was an animation was dummy coded (0 = non-animated, 1 = animated) and included as a moderator to test whether it has a significant effect on the relationship from release year to the average rating.

Other potential factors that were not specifically hypothesised but could influence ratings were added as control variables in the regression. This included runtime, and number of votes. Furthermore, a dummy was created for whether a movie was released before 2010 or after, in order to test the effect of the rise in streaming services since the international introduction of Netflix.

## Chapter 4: Findings

### Descriptive Statistics

The runtime of films looks similar for the different subsets, ranging between 90 and 100 minutes. When it comes to ratings, animated titles tend to score slightly higher on average, with a mean of 6.5 compared to 6.2 for other genres. For releaseyear the ratings look similar. The animated movies are underrepresented in the subset. And it can be seen that since 2010 many more movies are available but the movies are rated less times per movie.

| Subset | Observations | Mean Runtime (min) | Mean Rating | Mean Votes | SD Rating |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Animation | 1,846 | 90.5 | 6.51 | 43,393 | 1.08 |
| Non-Animation | 64,051 | 96.8 | 6.22 | 30,608 | 1.17 |
| Before 2010 | 20,537 | 97.0 | 6.29 | 35,085 | 1.14 |
| Since 2010 | 45,360 | 96.4 | 6.20 | 29,101 | 1.18 |

### T-Test

As visualised in \<graph 2\>, the average rating for animation movies with 6.509 (SD = ) is higher then for non-animation movies with 6.218 (SD = ). In further solidifying this, the independent t-test found that the difference, 0.291, BCa 95% CI [0.241, 0.341}, is significant t(1973) = 11.417, p = \< 0.001.

```{r independent t-test, echo=FALSE}
print(readLines("../gen/output/ttest_rating.txt"))
```

### Regression Analysis

### Findings

Both in model 1 and model 2 the start year dummy has a significant effect on the average movie ratings (p-value \< 0.001). In the most basic model, movies released since 2010 on average score 0.088 lower than movies that were released in the prior time period (1995-2009). When adding control variables, this average score is has a little less negative effect of 0.070. We do report a very low adjusted R2 in the first model (0.002872). This would hint to the start year dummy not having a big impact on explaining the movie rating differences. These results provide support for H1, indicating that movies released after 2010 tend to receive lower ratings than those released before, although the overall explanatory power of this effect is limited.

While the results for H1 point to a clear negative shift in ratings after 2010, the analyses for H2 do not provide evidence that this time effect differs between animated and non-animated films. In Model 3, we introduced interaction terms to examine whether the negative effect of release year on ratings is moderated by animation status. Neither the interaction between release since 2010 × animation nor the interaction between start year × animation reached statistical significance (p \> 0.05). This indicates no strong evidence that the slope of release year differs between animated and non-animated movies. While the control variables (runtime and number of votes) remained highly significant, the moderation effect central to H2 is not observed. Taken together, these findings suggest that H2 is not supported, as animation does not significantly moderate the negative relationship between release year and ratings.

## Chapter 5: Conclusions and Discussion

### Conclusion

Overall, the results indicate that movie ratings have declined slightly in the post-2010 era, supporting the notion that audiences have become more critical in the age of streaming. However, this temporal shift explains only a small portion of the variation in ratings, suggesting that other factors such as popularity and runtime play a more substantial role in how movies are evaluated. Moreover, the absence of a significant interaction effect implies that the changing rating patterns over time apply similarly to both animated and non-animated films. In sum, while there is evidence of a general negative trend in movie ratings after 2010 (H1), the moderation by animation status is not supported (H2).

### Limitations

<see SCRUM: part for AMANDA>

### Future Research

With data being created on a daily basis, the analysis of IMDB datasets remains an ongoing proces. By repeating this type of research over time it could reveal potential trends in IMDb ratings for animation movies compared to non-animated movies.

Future research could focus more on the role of movie popularity and its influence on IMDB rating. Many animated fils are reboots of older, nostalgic classics, which may affect audiences perception and engagement. These type of movies might attract more reviews due to their established fan base and may receive more critical evaluations becuase viewers have a direct point of c comparison with the original.

In addition, it would be valuable to examine whether there is a significant different in ratings between animated reboots and newly created animated concepts. These researches can also be done on TV shows, bring a different angle with some shows from gen-z youth still continuing to be produced in current day of time.
