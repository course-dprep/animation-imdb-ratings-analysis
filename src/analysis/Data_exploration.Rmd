# Data exploration

## 1. Data set description

**Data source**

For this project, a data set provided by IMDb (Internet Movie Database) was used. IMDb is an online database about movies, series, actors, directors and everything else related to the movie industry. Users can rate movies and series with a score from 1 to 10, and with that, IMDb shows a rating for each movie and provides rankings of the most popular movies.

The data sets used in this project are title.basics.tsv.gz and title.ratings.tsv.gz. Title.basics contains basic information about all titles on IMDb. Think about the name, start year, play time and genre. Title.ratings contains information about the ratings per title. The average rating and the number of votes are provided in this data set.

In this project, a subset of the data set is used, consisting only of movies, as the entire data set is too large and caused problems on some older laptops during data download.

**Data size**

The file raw_basics consists of 9 variables and 724580 observations. The file raw_ratings consists of 3 variables and 1609173 observations
