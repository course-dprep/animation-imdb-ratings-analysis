## Descriptive statistics

The runtime of films looks similar for the different subsets, ranging between 90 and 100 minutes. When it comes to average ratings, animated titles tend to score slightly higher on average, with a mean of 6.5 compared to 6.2 for other genres. For startyear the average ratings look similar. The animated movies are underrepresented in the subset. And it can be seen that since 2010 many more movies are available but the movies are rated less times per movie.


REMARK; WHY IN THIS GRAPH BELOW IS THE SD GIVEN AS THE ALST COLUMN? WHY NOT NEXT TO THE MEAN, THAT IS MORE LOGICAL

| Subset | Observations | Mean runtime minutes | Mean averageratings | Mean number of votes | SD averageratings |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Animation | 1,846 | 90.5 | 6.51 | 43,393 | 1.08 |
| Non-Animation | 64,051 | 96.8 | 6.22 | 30,608 | 1.17 |
| Before 2010 | 20,537 | 97.0 | 6.29 | 35,085 | 1.14 |
| Since 2010 | 45,360 | 96.4 | 6.20 | 29,101 | 1.18 |



## Visualizations

For the visualizations, three plots were selected that provided a good clear overview of relevant information about movies and movie types.

REMARK; I WOULD SPLIT THESE, SO NOT ALL THREE BELOW BUT FIRST A PICTURE AND THEN EXPLAIN WHAT IT DOES.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
# Line plot, average rating per year per type
knitr::include_graphics("../../gen/output/line_avg_rating_by_type.png")
# Smooth plot, average rating per year per type
knitr::include_graphics("../../gen/output/smooth_avg_rating_by_type.png")
# Boxplot, runtime
knitr::include_graphics("../../gen/output/boxplot_runtime.png")
```

In the first plot the average rating over time for animated and non-animated movies can be seen. It can be seen that the ratings are close but animated movies are typically rated somewhat higher than non-animated movies.

In the second plot it can be seen that the average rating for animated movies is declining over time and the rating of non-animated movies is not stable but in the last years the rating is increasing. 

In the last plot the distribution for runtime can be seen. It can be seen that for both genres the average runtime is similar and around 90/100 minutes. For both genres there are some outliers which are longer than 200 minutes, or under 50 minutes.




## Key insights

Some of the key insights that came forward after the initial data exploration were:

-	Due to the fact that there were a lot of missing values in the data set, this is something that may have consequences for the accuracy of the predictions, which has to be taken into account when analyzing the results. 

-	Animated titles are far less common than non-animated ones, so their summaries are based on fewer observations. 

-	Both groups show similar typical runtimes (roughly 90â€“100 minutes) but contain clear outliers, some films exceed 200 minutes while others are under 50. 

-	All titles tend to be widely rated, yet the average number of votes per film drops after 2010, consistent with a larger volume of releases spreading audience attention across more movies.
