## Descriptive statistics

In aligning with the focus of the research, four subsets were created were descriptive statistics were calculated of. These included;

- Animation movies
- Non-Animation movies
- Movies released before 2010
- Movies released since 2010

In further understanding the data, a function was created that calculates several descriptives for the different subsets, including the number of observations :

```{r}

#Function to generate descriptive statistics

inspect_data <- function(df) {
  cat("Generating descriptive statistics...\n\n")
  cat("\n\n")
  
  cat('Summary statistics\n')
  print(summary(df))
  cat('\n\n')
  
  cat('Number of observations in subset: ')
  cat(nrow(df))
  cat('\n\n')
  
  cat('Range in runtime:\n')
  print(max(df$runtimeMinutes) - min(df$runtimeMinutes))
  cat('\n\n')
  
  cat('Standard deviation of runtime:\n')
  print(sd(df$runtimeMinutes))
  cat('\n\n')
  
  cat('Range in average rating:\n')
  print(max(df$averageRating) - min(df$averageRating))
  cat('\n\n')
  
  cat('Standard deviation of average rating:\n')
  print(sd(df$averageRating))
  cat('\n\n')
  
  cat('Range in number of votes:\n')
  print(max(df$numVotes) - min(df$numVotes))
  cat('\n\n')
  
  cat('Standard deviation of number of votes:\n')
  print(sd(df$numVotes))
  cat('\n\n')
  
}

```

The Appendix shows the full output of generating these descriptives. Below, a table is provided that summarises some key statistics.


| Subset        | Observations | Mean runtime minutes | Mean averageratings | SD averageratings | Mean number of votes |
| ------------- | ------------ | -------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Animation     | 1,846        | 90.5                 | 6.51                | 1.08              | 43,393               |
| Non-Animation | 64,051       | 96.8                 | 6.22                | 1.17              | 30,608               |
| Before 2010   | 20,537       | 97.0                 | 6.29                | 1.14              | 35,085               |
| Since 2010    | 45,360       | 96.4                 | 6.20                | 1.18              | 29,101               |

The runtime of films looks similar for the different subsets, ranging between 90 and 100 minutes. When it comes to average ratings, animated titles tend to score slightly higher on average, with a mean of 6.5 compared to 6.2 for other genres. For startyear the average ratings look similar. The animated movies are underrepresented in the subset. And it can be seen that since 2010 many more movies are available but the movies are rated less times per movie.


## Visualizations

For the visualizations, three plots were selected that provided a good clear overview of relevant information about movies and movie types.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
# Line plot, average rating per year per type
knitr::include_graphics("../../gen/output/line_avg_rating_by_type.png")
```
In this plot the average rating over time for animated and non-animated movies can be seen. It can be seen that the ratings are close but animated movies are typically rated somewhat higher than non-animated movies.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
# Smooth plot, average rating per year per type
knitr::include_graphics("../../gen/output/smooth_avg_rating_by_type.png")
```
In this plot it can be seen that the average rating for animated movies is declining over time and the rating of non-animated movies is not stable but in the last years the rating is increasing. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
# Boxplot, runtime
knitr::include_graphics("../../gen/output/boxplot_runtime.png")
```

In this plot the distribution for runtime can be seen. It can be seen that for both genres the average runtime is similar and around 90/100 minutes. For both genres there are some outliers which are longer than 200 minutes, or under 50 minutes.


## Key insights

Some of the key insights that came forward after the initial data exploration were:

-	Due to the fact that there were a lot of missing values in the data set, this is something that may have consequences for the accuracy of the predictions, which has to be taken into account when analyzing the results. 

-	Animated titles are far less common than non-animated ones, so their summaries are based on fewer observations. 

-	Both groups show similar typical runtimes (roughly 90â€“100 minutes) but contain clear outliers, some films exceed 200 minutes while others are under 50. 

-	All titles tend to be widely rated, yet the average number of votes per film drops after 2010, consistent with a larger volume of releases spreading audience attention across more movies.
